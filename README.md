Austin, TX has many free outdoor fitness equipment areas, but their locations are not documented very well. This app lets users precisely find these locations. The app also denotes what equipment each spot has since none are the same. Users can also login and contribute their finds by inputting GPS coordinates and their images. Now, Austinites can quickly search to see where the nearest dip bars, sit-up benches, pull up bars, etc. is located for whatever their workout requires.

A fitness trail, or parcourse, is a path or course that is quipped with fitness stations. Austin Parcourses was to be the original name but Austin Fitness Trails seemed more recognizable to the general public. The new name may also be better for SEO.
